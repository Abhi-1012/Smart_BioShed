# Smart_BioShed

## Overview

This project involves the development of an autonomous shedding system designed to adapt to external temperature and rainfall conditions. Utilizing an Arduino Uno microcontroller, various sensors, motors, and relays, the system ensures efficient protection of assets by adjusting the shed's status in real-time based on environmental changes.

## Features

- **Real-time Adaptation:** Automatically closes the shed when high rainfall or temperature is detected and reopens when conditions normalize.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Uses sensors to continuously monitor temperature and rainfall, triggering actions based on predefined thresholds.
- **Efficient Protection:** Ensures the safety and protection of assets by adjusting the shed operations according to changing weather conditions.

## Components

- **Arduino Uno:** Microcontroller for managing system operations.
- **Sensors:** Monitors external temperature and rainfall.
- **Motors and Relays:** Controls the shed's opening and closing mechanisms.
